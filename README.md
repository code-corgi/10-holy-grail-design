# 10 Holy Grail Design

Change a layout, to resemble the popular holy grail design layout.

The holy grail refers to a web page layout which has multiple, equal height columns that are defined with style sheets. It is commonly desired and implemented, but for many years, the various ways in which it could be implemented with the current technologies all had drawbacks. Because of this, finding an optimal implementation was likened to searching for the elusive Holy Grail.

Learn more about it in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_grail_(web_design)).

In mobile, every element can be stacked in top of each other like it currently is.

The page currently looks like [this](https://github.com/code-corgi/10-holy-grail-design/settings).
